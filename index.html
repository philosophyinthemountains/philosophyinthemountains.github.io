May I consider the wise man rich. As for gold, let me have as much as a moderate man could bear and carry with him. Do we need anything else, Pheadrus? I believe my prayer is enough for me.</i>

	  <h2>Welcome</h2>
	  Filosofia in Montagna started as a group of friends who met at Heythrop College, University of London, during the undergraduate studies in Philosophy. The wish was to give philosophy a different dimension, closer to the everyday life, which could run parallel to the academic environment. A dimension centred on dialogue, cooperation and friendship. This wish was made concrete in Summer 2014, as many of us, together with other students, professors and friends, met for a week  in the Ligurian Alps, to discuss philosophy and live in close relationship with one another. In Summer 2015 the experiment was repeated, this time in the Bavarian Countryside and new friends joined the group. The <a href="manifesto.html">Manifesto</a> resulted from common discussions during this meeting.</p>
	
	<p>For the future we would like to share some of our ideas about the relation between philosophy, life and society with others. We wish to repeat our annual meetings and are open to help anyone interested.</p>
