	<h1>Philosophy from a distance, or how I stopped worrying and learned to love the WWW </h1>

	<p>
	Already before <em>Covid</em> we were aware that the vibe and inspiration of our annual meetings does not carry over to the rest of the year.
Having no means of communication except for email, which are written very sporadically, experiencing separation seems inevitable. </p>

	<p>
 Facing strict lockdowns during the pandemic, we moved our annual meeting online. This positive experience of connectedness over the internet sparked the idea to keep this format alive.
	</p>

<!--<img class="philipp-www" src="../gif/frida.gif"> </img>
	I will discuss with you a few thoughts about <strong>conversation and media consumption</strong>. Also I will share with you some things I have learned about html - in particular, how <em>easy it is to write and design a blog post</em>. Expressing yourself with means of a programming languages is also a form of art!

<p>
Additionally we setup this website. It ought to be a shared creative project and we are in the process of exploring its use cases.
We are aware that the motivation to produce content must be first and foremost intrinsic. We are no experts and we are not claiming to. Meaning can be found in inspiring readers, not necessarily in providing conclusive and consistent theories (although you are very welcome to try to ðŸ˜‰) â€“ thereby being in the spirit of the <a href="../manifesto.html">manifesto</a>:

<div class="blockquote"> "The thoughts we have are shared in their infancy, not first produced protectively, alone in the safety of the quiet study or library." </div>

<h2> Ideas looking forward </h2>
<p>
We seek to be inclusive and open to each other but also to people that want to take part.
However, affiliation requires participation, which we can try to animate:
</p>

<ol>
	<li> Enabling a "comment-section" to energize discussions. Allowing only insiders to comment is most effective protection from trolls ðŸ‘¹!
		<ul> <li> Team solutions like RocketChat, Slack, Discord or Teams come to mind (RocketChat even being OpenSource!!) </li> </ul>
	<li> Communication is also a habit. The closer new ideas are to what people are used to, the more likely they will adopt it (One doesn't just open a mumble server). So before plunging into action we should ask ourselves:
		<ul>
			<li> What does it add to WhatsApp, Zoom and Email? </li>
			<li> Is it convenient enough to use or does it require special expertise? </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> How about assigning "experts" to take responsibility for certain areas â€“ making the writing process more playful. </li>
	<li> The frequency of monthly meetings is convenient. To streamline organizing one-time-activities (like cooking, gaming, Fika) why not decide on a day that usually fits many of us â€“ an optional meeting day per week.</li>
	<li> Hosting a group meditation once a week.</li>
</ol>
<h2> Writing Blogs </h2>
<p>
If there is one takeaway from our discussion; <strong>don't fear html</strong>. You can do it, and I will help!
If you want to see what a blogpost looks like, <em>"right click"</em> on this page, <em>"view source code"</em> (or similar).
The code that is interesting for you is embraced by "&ltbody&gt" and "&lt/body&gt".
Save the code as .html file in a folder of your liking and play with it (using an "Text-Editor" â€“ i.e. NOT Word). You can always open the .html file in a browser to see how it looks.
Observe that the browser displays your code bare naked. You are missing the pictures and the file "stylesheet.css".
I can provide you with those if you feel fancy and want to to chisel yourself a monument.
