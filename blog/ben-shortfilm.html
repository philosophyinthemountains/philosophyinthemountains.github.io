	<h1>Intro to a playlist attempting to showcase the particular magic of short films</h1>

	<p>Can you name a short film? A classic, say, or a recent hit? If you can, you’re in a small minority, according to informal surveys I have conducted in recent years. </p>

	<p>Feature films and series are big news and widely viewed but, strangely, even as attention spans seem to be shrinking, short films remain pretty obscure.</p>

	<p>I don’t feel that I’ve got to the bottom of why that is, and perhaps there isn’t a simple answer. However, I do strongly believe that a correct answer would have to focus at least as much on economic, commercial and technological factors as on aesthetic and psychological ones.</p>

	<p>I think this partly because, in related artforms, such as music and dance, and poetry and prose writing, shorter forms are not nearly so obscure. In music and poetry, they’re even dominant.</p>

	<p>Granted, in one very closely related artform, theatre, there is a similar, perhaps yet more pronounced bias against shorter works. But then that relationship is, I think, not nearly as close as it might at first seem. Film, most obviously through animation, can do a lot that theatre can’t. More specifically, film is far from stuck with straight personal narratives, enacted by people; it can more freely explore ideas and feelings, representing them through any combination of visual and auditory means.</p>

	<p>It seems to me that the potential implied here is realised most fully in short films. After all, feature films and series almost invariably are straight personal narratives, enacted by people (or their cartoon equivalents). Shorts are a lot more likely to be non-character-based explorations of moods or isolated moments, or of concepts or whacky what-if scenarios. </p>

	<p>Again, I find it difficult to say with great confidence why short films tend to have these kinds of contents and feature films and series don’t so much.</p>

	<p>My guess would be that one major factor is the sheer expense of making feature films and series. To recoup that expense, they need to appeal to wider audiences, and perhaps, contingently or not, straight personal narratives more easily appeal to wider audiences. Then the flipside of that: many pioneering audio-visual artists – perhaps especially those that don’t deal in straight personal narratives – do not have access to such large budgets and so are priced out of making feature films and series. Then again, it might be that many such artists are not even drawn to working in those longer forms, and certain kinds of audio-visual artistic ideas and visions just, as a function of their very nature, tend to take shorter forms.</p>   

	<p>In any case, there’s a diversity of content in short films that there isn’t in feature films and series, and there are some very special kinds of artistry that are commonly found in the medium – kinds more akin to short-form poetry or dance or painting than theatre. There are, I should assure you, plenty of straight personal narratives in there too.</p>

	<p>A final point I’d like to make to the credit of short films is that, because of their comparatively low production costs, and perhaps also because of their distance from the public eye, they are a site of extraordinary experimentation and playfulness – I mean, there are far lower costs of failure with short films, and so some truly zaney and long-shot stuff gets tried in them, sometimes to stunning effect.</p>

	<p>I hope that this playlist demonstrates this diversity and these virtues I speak of!</p>
