<em>N.b. As discussed towards the end of our session, I use the word ‘trauma’ here quite loosely, to describe extreme, ongoing kinds of emotional pain and distress, rather than in the narrower sense used within professional therapy. I am not a professional therapist, and have no formal training in that area.  </em>
 
<h2>1) Are there not ways in which the 'professional' element of professional trauma therapy can undermine the trauma recovery process? </h2> (I'm thinking of things like the financial transaction, the very strict time constraints, and the absence of a broader loving relationship...) 
  
	<ul>
		<li> I think I was not, by the relevant standards, in such a terrible state when I had therapy, but I did struggle with these things – particularly, the experience of sometimes being turfed out when I really felt I needed to talk a little more, and the impossibility of bringing any kind of balance to the relationship with reciprocal concern and interest. Meanwhile, a friend once said to me, at a point when she was really, I think, borderline suicidal: ‘the only people who care about me are my parents, who are biologically compelled to, and my therapist, who I pay to.’ She had been seeing that therapist for years. </li>
		<li> I wonder, do professional therapists exist now because of weaknesses in our socio-familial fabrics? Presumably, hundreds of years ago, family, friends and community elders played therapist roles, more or less well; presumably they were often far more practiced in playing those roles too. </li>
		<li> Another consequence of us not having many people to go to with our crises and our traumas is that we’re at greater risk of overburdening those we can go to. </li>
		<li> I strongly believe we, as societies, need to work to reestablish stronger social bonds. Certainly in the meantime there is a need for professional therapists. </li>
		<li> I also think there will always be a need for <em>trained</em> therapists, whether ‘professional’ or not. The training is important in enabling them to really help, and to prevent themselves becoming overburdened in the process. Presumably, in centuries past, training – at least outside of institutions like the church – was very informal, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t occur. Then again, I don’t doubt modern scholarship has enabled great advances on this front,  so that formal training is now required in order to be the best possible therapist. </li>
		<li> I’d also say that part of what it means to be a good professional therapist is to be able and ready to deal with the limitations and the particular relationship dynamics resulting from the professionalism. That is, a good therapist has contingency plans for if the patient can’t afford the sessions any more, and can manage the tempo and structure of a session, to help avoid it ending at the worst possible point, etc. </li>
		<li> Finally, I suspect the limitations of professional therapists may actually be helpful in some cases, inasmuch as, whoever we go to with our pain and problems, they will have their limitations – professional therapy might help us to properly grasp and be prepared for that, especially if the reasons for the therapist’s limitations are explicit throughout, which I think they generally should be. </li>
	</ul> 
<h2>2) Are there particular dangers for a friend or romantic partner, in assuming the role of trauma therapist? </h2>
	<ul> 
		<li> There are obvious points here. A friend or romantic partner might, for instance, end up feeling used, particularly as the months and years go by. They might wonder: Am I just free therapy? Would this person want this relationship with me, if it weren’t for this help I’m giving them? And, particularly if it’s a romantic relationship – am I effectively <em>exploiting</em> their need for this help?  </li>
		<li> A romantic partner might also come to suspect almost the opposite of that they’re being used; they might wonder, do I feel such a strong attachment to this person partly because of the repeated self-esteem buzz they give me by enabling me to always play the hero, the saviour? </li>
		<li> Also, the therapist role or dynamic could, perhaps very easily, take over the relationship, come to dominate what a friend or partner is in the eyes of the one needing help, or vice-versa. Maybe, for instance, the one needing help won’t, after a certain point, be inclined to go to this friend or partner for fun, because they just won’t now think of that as being what they’re for. Maybe they’ll even associate them now with their own pain and weakness, and, in escaping those things, they’ll feel a need to escape them.  </li>
		<li> And then of course it can be an overwhelming task, taking up time and energy the friend or partner just doesn’t have in the long-run, or should be devoting to other things. </li>
		<li> There wouldn’t be these problems with a professional therapist. And, just as important as any of this, if the friend or partner doesn’t have the required professional training, there’s surely a great risk that they’ll fail to really help, or even make mistakes, which could be terrible in their consequences. And they’d then have to live with that, assuming they were fortunate/unfortunate enough to see it. </li>
	</ul>
 
<h2>3) What is the utility of bullshit in overcoming trauma, or in bearing a traumatic experience as it's unfolding, and what are the vulnerabilities that come with reliance for these purposes on different types of bullshit? </h2>
	<ul> 
		<li> Jordan Peterson says that people whose selves are in complete disarray can benefit from almost any kind of therapy – never mind the fact that different kinds of therapy are based on mutually incompatible theories of the self and of the self’s fragmentation. Basically, any scheme of explanation, even a thoroughly wrong one, is better than none, he thinks. <em>(12 Rules for Life, p. 222)</em> </li>
		<li> Jean Amery talks about how the religious people and the very ideologically-driven people in Nazi concentration camps coped a lot better than the sceptical, secular people, like himself. And, crucially, he says it didn’t matter what the religion or ideology was. Catholic converts, Orthodox Jews, Marxists – it didn’t matter. The important point, as Amery saw it, was that, through their religion or ideology, even if it consisted largely of false beliefs, they transcended their selves, stopped being captive to their individuality. <em>(At the Mind’s Limits, p. 12-14)</em> </li>
		<li> Just because the Marxist or Orthodox way of thinking worked better in that context than Amery’s own secular, sceptical way of thinking, that doesn't mean there wasn't or couldn't have been a really true way of thinking (maybe even one that could be characterised as secular and sceptical) that would have served him or others just as well, if not better. </li>
		<li> Still, I wonder what reason we have for believing that a really true way of thinking would be likely to serve us better than various possible bullshit ones. In some sense, the truth is all around us, there is no escaping the truth. But then, looking at what people around the world live and die believing, it’s not clear that that counts for so very much. Our thinking is fallible enough for us to come to think the truth is wrong, perhaps just as easily as we come to think falsehoods are. Maybe we’d be better off with bullshit that fitted the deep-rooted or even inherent biases of our hearts and minds than truths that didn’t. </li>
	</ul> 
<h2>4) Are there times when trauma just cannot be overcome - or perhaps can, but only by turning into a radically different person? </h2>
	<ul> 
		<li> Suppose you’ve decidated yourself for 15-20 years to bringing up your children, you’re totally dedicated to them, they’re your whole world, and then they die horribly... Can you ever fully overcome such an experience?  </li>
		<li> I take it that an important part of overcoming trauma, and particularly grief, is finding new sources of meaning, new things to care about, new and viable life projects to become engaged in... Time replaces the old combination of cares and values, which has become non-viable, with the new. Or at least it does if you can and do give it the opportunity to, by exposing yourself to new things. But so many factors can hold you back here – for instance, if the loss or the traumatic experience is still somehow in progress, or if there’s a puzzle attached it, or if the thing you’ve lost or that’s become non-viable in you was just so central to your value system, and to any value system you could have… There are limitations on how much of a transformation you can accomplish, especially in the finite life you have left to live. </li>
		<li> I think of Petra Costa, her documentary <em>Elena</em>, about coming to terms with the suicide of her older sister, who she idolised: 'Little by little, the pain turns to water. It becomes memory. Memories go with time, they fade. But some find no solace, just bits of relief, in the small openings of poetry. You are my inconsolable memory, made of shadow and stone. From it, all is born and dances.' I understand her to mean by this that it’s always there – the suicide of her sister – and it’s still a source of pain, but less, little by little, and it has become in the meantime a kind of basis of thinking and feeling, a foundationstone of her life now… helping shape all that she does and is, motivating good acts and causes too, enriching her appreciation of all that she has and can offer, and filling her art, which serves to commemorate and explicate and warn and do a kind of justice. Something like that. So maybe Petra Costa hasn’t fully overcome her sister’s suicide, but she’s found this way of living with it nonetheless. </li>
