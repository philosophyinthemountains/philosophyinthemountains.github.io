<h1>What is Filosofia in Montagna</h1>

<!--# include file="/menu.html" -->

<p>Filosofia in Montagna started as a group of friends who met at Heythrop College, University of London, during the undergraduate studies in Philosophy. The wish was to give philosophy a different dimension, closer to the everyday life, which could run parallel to the academic environment. A dimension centred on dialogue, cooperation and friendship. This wish was made concrete in Summer 2014, as many of us, together with other students, professors and friends, met for a week  in the Ligurian Alps, to discuss philosophy and live in close relationship with one other. In Summer 2015 the experiment was repeated, this time in the Bavarian Countryside and new friends join the group. The Manifesto resulted from common discussions during this meeting.</p>

<p>For the future we would like to share some of our ideas about the relation between philosophy, life and society with others. We wish to repeat our annual meetings and are open to help anyone interested.</p>
