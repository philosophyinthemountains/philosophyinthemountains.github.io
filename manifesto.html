		<p> <em>“We hope to find new ways of interpreting ourselves, the world around us, and the community which we are a part of.”</em> <p>
		<p>We seek the realization of a vision: of philosophy as a form of life, a dedication to ideas that is playful and inquisitive.</p>
		<p>In today’s academic world, a variety of factors have obscured the possibility of such a reality: the increasing pressures of employment in academia; individualism driving the major socio-economic structures; and the ever-increasing complexity of the world in which the importance of instrumental reason makes philosophical reasoning, in its traditional form, seem useless. In light of these obscuring factors, we attempt to give philosophical life a different form.<p>
		<p>In the space we make our home for a period each year, we live philosophy in the form of continual conversation, as part of ordinary shared activities such as cooking, dancing, eating, walking, and more. Thinking stands by nourishment, freedom, and love as a basic need. The thoughts we have are shared in their infancy, not first produced protectively, alone in the safety of the quiet study or library. Guards are low and the spirit is one of sharing. The thoughts are made by us all together and their yield belongs to each one of us equally. Solitary reflection is balanced with an openness to others’ perspectives. By living philosophy in the non-professional environment of the home, in which it was practiced for centuries, our vision gains existence. In this, we hope to (re)discover our interests and our concerns.</p>
		<p>We hope to find new ways of interpreting ourselves, the world around us, and the community which we are a part of. That the fruits of participation in such a way of life might be shared with others too, is something we now wish to make possible.</p>
